To better understand the Go lanuage I decided to look through the documentation as well as the source code of the language.
What has helped is that there are various amounts of test cases and code that explains what its purpose is and what it is 
suppose to do. One test case that has helped me is example_test.go. The purpose of it is to display the time and what the error
was when it occured. The reason it helped me understand the language better was because it shows how to create a function, import classes,
print messages, and return values. This may seem simple in another language but for someone who has barely ever used Go, it showed 
me how to put things together.
