What I have done so far is to try and better understand the Go language and looking at examples of test cases to see how they were done. 
I know just the basics of the Go language so viewing test cases and source code has led to me understanding the language more. Multiple
test cases in the folders makes it easier to see how test cases are done in this language.(Apparentley I pushed into another one of my repositories 
by mistake).
